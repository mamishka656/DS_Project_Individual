    "Using the provided datasets, a player’s engagement in the game can be a good marker of how probable they are to subscribe to a newsletter, as an unengaged player may be less likely to engage and subscribe to a whole newsletter. The beginning of a player's engagement can be found by determining the minimum value of session_start_time in the session dataset for each player. Then, the dataset can be filtered to only include sessions played within 7 days of their initial session and determine the average number of hours played per session; this will measure the frequency of playing (number of sessions) and commitment of each play (average session duration). This will provide a wrangled dataset with only the variables needed. \n"
